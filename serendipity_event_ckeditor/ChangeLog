      force the script to redirect directly into the config on each
      CKEditor upgrade request.
      In case of using the Serendipity UPDATE ALL 1-click ajax-upgrader,
      this redirection is disabled and you have to force the extraction
      yourself in the config.
    * Disabled the temporary runtime solution to downgrade version for
      the harmonization of plugin and lib versions, which came in March
      2016 with this plugins "old" 5.7.0.x version (see below).

    * Introduce new config option to re-enable the CKE built-in image toolbar button.
      This is not recommended to do, but there may be people in need.
    MAJOR CHANGE:
      In Serendipity 2.0 development, we discovered CKEDITOR storing htmlentities
      to the database, which is ok normally, but does not work for search request results.
      We have now disabled config.entities and config.htmlEncodeOutput for the editor,
      to strictly let S9y handle this.
      The not catched search results did only happen to Umlauts or specialized chars!
      If you really are subjected to this for previous entries stored by this plugin editor,
      you will have to call and re-submit these entries again. Sorry!

    * The preset toolbars now hide the CKE image widget per css, but keep its internal
      functionality for the image placements via the S9y MediaLibrary button.
    * Touched some lang files.
    * Moved custom codesnippet css into highlight.css
    * Reset cached js configuration files on submit changes by timestamp
    * Renamed some global js vars
    PLEASE NOTE:
      As ever: Hard reload your browser by [CTRL]-[r] to avoid caching
      on first run in a Serendipity backend textarea

-----
    * Upgrade to CKEDITOR 4.4 Series, update 5 (http://ckeditor.com/whatsnew)
      MAJOR CHANGE:
    * This package is a full ckeditor release package now.
    * Manually added plugins are:
        - dependency plugins widget and lineutils
        - codesnippet, which replaces the previously used pbckcode plugin
          This new code plugin has by default more code types, does not
          need any CDN, and uses less ressources being better integrated.
          But it uses a different highlighter js file (hightlight.pack.js).
    * Changed option prettify to be a compat mode only option for ugraders
      having used pbckcode code previously for entries.
      This also adds some missed prettify linenums css rules.

    * Touched some lang files.

    * Completely remove(d) the KCfinder package, due to strong security concerns.
        This update will remove the package completely from file tree.
        If that does not happen automatically, please purge the kcfinder directory by hand!
        This does not touch the previously used MediaLibrary KCfinder /uploads/images directory.
    * Update pbckcode plugin to v.1.2.3, which among others now fetches ACE via a CDN!
        See PBCKCODE (PRETTIFY) configuration in cke_config.js.
        Added a pre wrap modification to the prettify.css file:
          pre.prettyprint{ ...;white-space:pre;overflow:auto;}

-----
    * Some tweaks to en, de lang files.
    * Fixed force_install to set new values to database config table.
    * Fixed Spartacus upgrade 'plugin_to_conf' again, by using 'external_plugin' hook, 
      which now forces a real HTTP request and falls down to plugins instance config.
      The previous (2.3.2) 'install_plugin' did do, but created another plugin instance.
      If you were hit by this, please just purge other ckeditor instances in your plugin list.
      To push to "all" upgraders, the zip version num was bumped to force a deflate.

      [PLEASE NOTE: For Upgraders coming from 2.3.1 and earlier, the upgrade zip effect 
       may possibly happen on next future upgrade only, thus force the zip upgrade by the
       new 'force_install' emergency option, if not happen automatically.]

         cke_plugin.js - the render and add button/plugin file, which loads the custom config file and now renders all backend textareas.
    * To take care about placed javascript, smarty tags and other protected source tags (like 'mediainsert' by imageselectorplus galleries), 
         the new 'procurator' CKEDITOR Plugin (s9y-specific) was added, which acts like a hidden event plugin 
         and takes care for the placeholder wysiwyg-mode replacements.
    * In order to be able to place prettified code snippets into entries, the 
         'pbckcode' CKEDITOR Plugin was added (v 1.1.0, https://github.com/prbaron/PBCKCode).
