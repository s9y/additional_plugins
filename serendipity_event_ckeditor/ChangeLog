2.3.0:
-----
    * Check if zip extension loaded
    * Removed most of the inline code into 2 new files, which are:
         cke_config.js - the custom config.js file, which now substitutes every config option to CKE
         cke_plugin.js - the render and add button/plugin file, which loads the custom config file and now renders all backend textareas.
    * To take care about placed javascript, smarty tags and other protected source tags (like mediainsert by imageselectorplus galleries), 
         the new 'procurator' CKEDITOR Plugin (s9y-specific) was added, which acts like a hidden event plugin and takes care for the placeholder wysiwyg-mode replacements.
    * In order to be able to place prettified code snippets into entries, the 
         'pbckcode' CKEDITOR Plugin was added (v 1.1.0, https://github.com/prbaron/PBCKCode).
