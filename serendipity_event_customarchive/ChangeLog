Propagate $smarty.env.staticpage_pagetitle (and the others) so that it can be used in entries.tpl
latest: Smarty3 forward compatibility

1.11:
-----

Added new smarty function to allow building for archive overviews based
on custom entryproperties. See the serendipity_event_customarchive.php file
for example use of the Smarty function, that you can for example use
on static pages using the Smarty Markup plugin. The entryproperties plugin
is required to enter the metadata that this plugin operates on.
