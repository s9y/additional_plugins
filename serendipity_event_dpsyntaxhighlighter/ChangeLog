3.0.83.2
- Hotfixes for PHP 8 (surrim)

3.0.83.1
- Added German translation.

2.1.364 Updates:
- updated to new upstream code
- legacy support is included (http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter:Upgrading)
- version has become a variable in order to easily upgrade on upstream upgrade (just add new directory to /sh/ directory and change the variable)
- theme and scripts directory dynamically read to retrieve all brushes and themes
- theme can be selected in admin interface
- s9y plugin authors mentioned in help window ;-)

1.5.1 Updates:
- Version number now corresponds to the actual JS script this is running
  instead of the version of the plugin - this should make it easier for people
  to know if they're running an older or up-to-date version.

- Descriptive text updated. I'm no longer running a modified version of the
  CSS. Alex Gorbechev took most of my suggestions from the bug tracker and
  fixed up his CSS.
  
- Author information now gives initial credit to Alex Gorbechev (core) and
  then me (plugin)
    
- The descriptive text now tells people that the theme requires the
  frontend_header, frontend_footer[/b], and optionally the
  backend_preview hooks to work.
