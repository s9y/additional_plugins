Potential v1.17 version?

My changes add the following:
   * Ability to connect to Microsoft Active Directory LDAP interface. For
     this, one MUST issue the 2 commands:
       ldap_set_option($ds,LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, 3);
       ldap_set_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, 0);
     juste after the ldap_connect
   * Ability to connect to LDAPs not supporting anonymous browsing via the 2
     new config vars 'bind_user' &  'bind_password'
   * Ability to use LDAPs where users are not cleanly stored in one part of
     the tree, i.e., one have to perform a search with the login name on all
     the subtree given in 'rdn' with an LDAP search-expression given in the
     new config variable 'auth_query' with %-expansion of rdn
   * Setting the s9y 'realname' field from the LDAP 'name' one in all cases

For instance in my config at ILOG,
   rdn = DC=ilog,DC=biz
   bind_user = CN=webcoreadreaddev,CN=Users,DC=ilog,DC=biz
   bind_password = noneofyourbusiness
   auth_query = (&(objectcategory=person)(objectclass=user)(sAMAccountName=%1))

I changed the files
   * serendipity_event_externalauth.php for the code
   * lang_en.inc.php for the english descriptive text of the new 3 options
   * ChangeLog.txt I added this file.
