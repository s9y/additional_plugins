 * Added a new option to allow showing taglink entries as a linklist.
    This adds a 'taglist' tag as a reserved command to tags,
    which not allows this tag as a normal tag any further.
    The addition can be done either by the preset taglink as "/plugin/taglist/"
    or manually added by certain taglinks as "/plugin/tag/allyourtags/taglist".
    This needs you to modify your templates entries.tpl file,
    as described in the documentation file or the README.
