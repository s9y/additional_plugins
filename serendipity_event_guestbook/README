 PLEASE NOTE

This Serendipity guestbook plugin is TEMPLATE based, configurable by its own stylesheet, has a FRONTEND and a BACKEND. Please read the Config, Admin, Design and last modified entry Changelog Section of this file carefully.

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: CONFIG SETTINGS

    * The 'Permalink' defines a permalink for the URL. Needs the absolute HTTP path and needs 
      to end with .htm or .html! The Serendipity default value is "/blogname/pages/guestbook.html", 
      or, in case you are not using mod_rewrite, "/blogname/index.php?/pages/guestbook.html".
    * The 'Static Pagetitle & URL' defines the staticpage title of the page.
      Attention: this also defines the URL of the page (index.php?serendipity[subpage]=name). 
      Just one short name without whitespaces (default: guestbook).
    * The 'Headline' defines a headline for the frontpage view (optional).
    * The 'Intro' defines additional introductory Text (optional).
    * The 'Guestbook form order' defines the place of your guestbook form (default: top).
    * The 'Entries per page' defines how many entries to display per page (default: 10).
    * The 'Entries per page' backend defines how many entries to display per page (default: 15).
    * The 'Characters per line (Wordwrap)' defines after how many chars a guestbook text line will 
      be automatically wrapped (default: 120).
    * The 'Format as article' defines if the output is automatically formatted as an article 
      (colors, borders, etc.) (default: yes).
    * The 'Send e-mail to admin' defines email information of new entries (default: false).
    * The 'E-mail of admin' set the email adress to send to.
    * The 'Ask for User Email' defines a form field for the e-mail of the user (default: yes).
    * The 'Show Captchas' defines the use of Serendipity CAPTCHAS (requires Spamblock plugin activated) 
      to prevent comment SPAM (default: yes).
    * The 'Ask for User Homepage' defines a form field for the homepage of the user (default: false).
    * The 'Approve entries' defines the guestbook entries to be verified by admin in general,
      before they show up in frontend (default: false).
    * The 'Auto-moderate' defines the same behaviour for a single entry, if the SPAMBLOCK-plugin 
      wordfilter option is active and set to 'moderate', caused by stopword matches (default: false). 
      The guestbook content evaluation will still return captcha checking, if any spam check 
      evaluates true. This differs from normal spamblock behaviour!
    * The 'Entry checks' sets an active and individual guestbook wordfilter array (default: pre-filled). 
      Regular Expressions are allowed, separate strings by semicolons (;). You have to escape special 
      chars with "\". If you leave this field empty, no special checks are done. This check is bypassed 
      for authenticated users with USERLEVEL_ADMIN only!
    * The 'Date format' sets a strftime() code for the entry datetime (default: %a, %d.%m.%Y %H:%M).

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: ADMINISTRATION

    * The administration area is in backend only.
    * The backend sidebar carries a link to administer the guestbook. There are 4 main points to show up:
      -   view approved entries,
      -   view unapproved entries (if 'Approve entries' is set to true),
      -   edit or insert an entry,
      -   the database section.
    * Each of the first 2, have the ability to (confirm), erase (immediately!), or re-edit a single entry
    * The database section will allow: backup & download, or purge the SQL table instantly. (Be careful!)
    * A link to SQL insert is shown, but not active, since this isn't trivial enough by now.

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: DESIGN

    * All smarty tpls, images and stylesheets of this plugin are located in the plugin folder 
      and remain to stay there.
    * If you are skilled and wish to have an personal frontend design, copy these files to your template 
      ( plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl, plugin_guestbook_form.tpl, style_guestbook_frontend.css ).
    * For changing the frontend entry background colors only, copy these neutral white css directives:
      /* styles guestbook entry colors neutral */
      /* the entry headline */
      .guestbook_entrytop { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* the entry background color */
      .guestbook_entrybottom { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* admin comment line */
      span.guestbook_admin_comment { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* the bottom shadow line */
      #guestbook_entrybundle { -moz-border-radius: 0 0; background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      to the end of your templates user.css file, if you have one (suggested approach!).
      In the other case copy the style_guestbook_frontend.css file to your template folder,
      set above directives to the end and change the #FFF to your prefered color (#FFF is neutral white).
    * If you want to purge the frontend entry borders too, add: border: 0 none; to each of them.
    * If you even wish to change all frontend entry text colors, add:
      #guestbook_entrybundle table,
      #guestbook_entrybundle table a,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_entrytop,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_entrybottom,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment p,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote p,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote p q { color: #000; } 
      for a black text color (#000).
    * No space between frontend entry blocks? Add:
      .guestbook_splitentries { display: none; visibility: hidden; }
    * The Intro, if set in config, can be modified with: 
      #guestbook_wrapper .guestbook_intro { 
      padding: 0 none; text-align: left; border: 0 none; background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
    * You can find a nice list of available web colours here: http://www.wackerart.de/rgbfarben.html. 
      Happy designing!

-------------------------------------
| Version 2.8 to 3.11 - 2007-2009   |
-------------------------------------
    * some tweaks by Garvin see ChangeLog


-------------------------------------
| Version 2.8 - 2007-07-23          |
-------------------------------------

    * ATTENTION: This version needs you to verify and set/submit the guestbook config again!

    * Changed lang files. The lang files <en>, <de> and <de-utf8> are now up to date. 
    * If you update other lang files please change the first line to 
      $Id: serendipity_event_guestbook.php, langfile(short name) v2.8 200x/xx/xx name

    * Images new and moved and old files clean up.
    * Deleted the very old 'plugin_guestbook.tpl' file: this confuses newbies. Please do the same!
    * button_background.png and shorttime.gif belong into plugins img folder. 
    * Please delete them in plugin folder to not confuse anybody. 
    * Added blank.gif and info.gif, which is the config help picture, into plugins img folder. 

    * Changed plugin_guestbook_form.tpl. 
    * make use of the new smarty vars 
    * if set: popup and show messages
    * Now a user using the popup issue can view his entry after DB INSERT. 
    * changed action="{$plugin_guestbook_action}#entry" to 
      action="{$commentform_action}?frontpage#feedback" inside plugin_guestbook_form.tpl. 
      This seems necessary if you use a static page as your start page. 
      Be sure to have the staticpage plugin in order before the contactform and guestbook plugin.
      Well, actually the '?frontpage' will be done in serendipity_event_guestbook.php. 
    * added admin stuff
    * modified some css

    * Changed plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl. 
    * make use of the new smarty vars 
    * if set: order form on top or end and be able to even link to the form
    * moved some things around
    * added admin stuff and a missing <td></td>, which seems nessessary!
    * modified some css

    * Changed, cleaned and modified the style_guestbook_backend.css 
    * you may put a very own version of both tpl and css files inside your template folder.

>> GH: TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED
    * One extra dynamic field added (dyn).
    * I don't think there is any need to use mgroeninger's excellent dynamic function from contactform.

    * In order to make things more configurable, these vars were changed or added (see lang files):
    * 'headline'      staticpage headline on top of page, by Garvin (v. 2.7).
    * 'intro'         is used for free additional text entry on top of guestbook page.
    * 'pageurl'       now called permalink, while pagetitle is used as the original (1.x) pageurl and for 
                      staticpage_pagetitle, see below. (Sounds messy, I know, but this is more straight!)
    * 'pagetitle'     is used in staticpages and other templates and defines the URL of the page 
                      'index.php?serendipity[subpage]=name'.
    * 'formorder'     decide to have form appear first, default is form at end of entries.
    * 'formpopup'     decide to have the form appear in a popup page, default (yes) is no popup.

    >>GH:TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED!
    * 'showdynfield'  this is a basic dynamic field as a mysql varchar(100) field. 
                      Use with a input field in plugin_guestbook_form.tpl 
                      and as a text output in plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl.
                      I tried it with a tinyblob field, but it is not a very good idea to store 
                      binary data in databases, and so I came back to this small input text field.
                      If you want to change this field with another label name, set config dynfield 
                      to the new name and submit.
    * Fixed a small bug in paginator function.
    * General code clean up and moved things around. More documented code.
    * Now this really is a fully template version (99.9% ;-)). 
    * Moved some remaining divs and some admin stuff into the tpls.
    * Sorry, there are still some needs inside functions for remaining line breaks and the urls of 
      the paginator function.
    * Good news! The code for the staticpage plugin at the end oft this page is obsolet by now. 
    * We'll keep the compatibility to 1.x until next 3.x release.


-------------------------------------
| Version 2.5 to 2.7 - 2007-??-??   |
-------------------------------------
    * some tweaks by Garvin


-------------------------------------
| Version 2.0 to 2.4 - 2006-10-06   |
-------------------------------------

    * Some link generation changes to generate_EntriesPage() to make it work with/without mode_rewrite

    * Guestbookform tpl action url is now: $serendipity['baseURL'] . $serendipity['indexFile'] . '#entry'
    * Changed sidebar serendipity_event_staticpage.php to be compat to guestbook 2.0 version too (code1). 
      In case you allready used this plugin to show a link to the guestbook plugin in your sidebar, 
      please go into admin panel, go to static pages, and say yes again to show guestbook plugin. 
      Doing this, changes to code will take effect.
    * Made sidebar serendipity_plugin_guestbook work with 2.0 version only
    * Target admin mail address should now be compat to old guestbook v.1.38, just one targetmail used
    * Markup config var makes tpl based entries output get parsed through S9y standard text formatting
      and converting standard smilies
    * Change old guestbook table now works for MySql (only?)
    * More cleanup / renaming and reconfigured wordwrap in config for 2.0 final
    * Now the guestbook should work well with/without CAPTCHAS - this needed a new config variable 
      so please check your Captchas settings in spamblock and! guestbook plugins
    * Generell clean up and messages tweaks.
    * Now serendipity_event_guestbook is nearly full template based (see plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl 
      and plugin_guestbook_form.tpl)
    * You will find images shorttime.gif, button_background.png and delete.png in $this_plugin/img dir
    * Change css (style_guestbook_backend.css) and template files to your needs
    * Please check other lang files - actualy only <en>, <de> and <de-utf8> will work!
    * Permalink ("pageurl") is a full path from http root eg. "/serendipity/pages/guestbook.html" 
      or "/serendipity/index.php?/pages/guestbook.html" (see mod_rewrite)
    * Note: This version is making use of plugin::spamblock features and captchas (disabled for admins),
    * Note: timelock and sessionlock config vars will not be used anymore - removed by table update
