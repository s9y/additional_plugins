 PLEASE NOTE

This Serendipity guestbook plugin is TEMPLATE based, configurable by its own stylesheet, has a FRONTEND and a BACKEND.
Please read the Config, Admin, Design and last modified entry Changelog Section of this file carefully.

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: CONFIG SETTINGS

    * The 'Permalink' setting defines a permalink for the URL. Needs the absolute HTTP path and needs to end with .htm or .html!
      The Serendipity default value is "/blogname/pages/guestbook.html", or, in case you are not using mod_rewrite, "/blogname/index.php?/pages/guestbook.html".
    * The 'Static Pagetitle & URL' setting defines the staticpage title of the page.
      Attention: this also defines the URL of the page (index.php?serendipity[subpage]=name). Just one short name without whitespaces (default: guestbook).
    * The 'Headline' setting defines the headline of the page inside your blog with your normal blog design (optional).
    * The 'Intro' setting defines additional introductory Text (optional).
    * The 'Guestbook form order' setting defines the place of your guestbook form, on top or bottom of the entries (default: top).
    * The 'Entries per page' setting defines how many entries to display per page (default: 10).
    * The 'Characters per line (Wordwrap)' setting defines after how many characters a guestbook text line will be automatically wrapped (default: 120).
    * The 'Format as article' setting defines if the output is automatically formatted as an article (colors, borders, etc.) (default: yes).
    * The 'Send e-mail to admin' setting defines email information of entries. The admin gets an e-mail for each new entry. Insert email address on next step (default: false).
    * The 'User Email' setting defines a form field for the e-mail of the user (default: yes).
    * The 'User Homepage' setting defines a form field for the homepage of the user (default: false).
    * The 'Show Captchas' setting defines the use of Serendipity CAPTCHAS (requires Spamblock plugin activated) to prevent comment SPAM (default: yes).
    * The 'Approve entries' setting defines the guestbook entries to be verified by admin generally before they show up in frontend (default: false).
    * The 'Auto-moderate' setting defines the same behaviour for a single entry, if the SPAMBLOCK-plugin wordfilter option is activ and set to 'moderate', caused by stopword matches (default: false). The guestbook content evaluation will still return captcha checking, if any spam check evaluates true. This differs from normal spamblock behaviour!
    * The 'Entry checks' setting sets an active and individual wordfilter array (default: pre-filled). Regular Expressions are allowed, separate strings by semicolons (;). You have to escape special chars with "\". If you leave this field empty, no special checks are done.
    * The 'Date format' setting defines an individual strftime() code for the entry datetime (default: %a, %d.%m.%Y %H:%M).

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: ADMINISTRATION

    * Backend and frontend administration is possible, if logged in. The frontend administration allows erasing entries only, but will ask you to proceed. Frontend administration got removed with 3.24 version.
    * The backend sidebar has a new link to administer the guestbook. There are 4 main points to show up:
      1.   view approved entries,
      2.   view unapproved entries (if 'Approve entries' is set to true),
      3.   edit or insert an entry,
      4.   the database section.
    * Each of the first two, have the ability to (confirm,) erase (immediately!), or re-edit a single entry.
    * The database section will allow: backup and download the plugin database table, or erase the SQL table instantly. Be careful working here!
    * A link to SQL insert is shown, but not active, since this isn't trivial enough by now.

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: DESIGN

    * All smarty tpls, images and the one main stylesheet of this plugin are located in the plugin folder and remain to stay there.
    * If you are skilled and wish to have an individual frontend design, copy the files to change to your template folder only
      ( plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl, plugin_guestbook_form.tpl, style_guestbook_backend.css ).
    * In case you wish to change the frontend entry background colors only, copy these neutral white css directives:
      /* styles guestbook entry colors neutral */
      /* the entry headline */ .guestbook_entrytop { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* the entry background color */ .guestbook_entrybottom { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* the admin comment line */ span.guestbook_admin_comment { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* the bottom shadow line */ #guestbook_entrybundle { -moz-border-radius: 0 0; background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      to the end of your templates user.css file, if you have one (suggested approach!).
      If your template does not support an individual stylesheet, copy the style_guestbook_backend.css file to your template folder,
      set the directives to the end and change the #FFF to your prefered color (#FFF is neutral white).
    * If you want to purge the frontend entry borders too, add: border: 0 none; to each of them.
    * If you even wish to change all frontend entry text colors, add:
      #guestbook_entrybundle table,
      #guestbook_entrybundle table a,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_entrytop,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_entrybottom,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment p,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote p,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote p q { color: #000; } 
      for a black text color (#000).
    * No space between frontend entry blocks? Add: .guestbook_splitentries { display: none; visibility: hidden; }
    * The Intro, if set in config, can be modified with: #guestbook_wrapper .guestbook_intro { padding: 0 none; text-align: left; border: 0 none; background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
    * You can find a very nice list of available web colours here http://www.wackerart.de/rgbfarben.html. Happy designing!

-------------------------------------
| Version 2.8 to 3.11 - 2007-2009   |
-------------------------------------
- some tweaks by Garvin see ChangeLog


-------------------------------------
| Version 2.8 - 2007-07-23          |
-------------------------------------

- ATTENTION: This version needs you to verify and set/submit the guestbook config again!

- Changed lang files. The lang files <en>, <de> and <de-utf8> are now up to date. 
    ***    If you update other lang files please change the first line to 
        $Id: serendipity_event_guestbook.php, langfile(short name) v2.8 200x/xx/xx name

- Images new and moved and old files clean up.
    ***    Deleted the very old 'plugin_guestbook.tpl' file: this confuses newbies. Please do the same!
    ***    button_background.png and shorttime.gif belong into plugins img folder. 
    ***    Please delete them in plugin folder to not confuse anybody. 
    ***    Added a blank.gif and a info.gif, which actually is the config help picture, into plugins img folder. 

- Changed plugin_guestbook_form.tpl. 
    ***    make use of the new smarty vars 
    ***    if set: popup and show messages
    ***    Now a user using the popup issue can view his entry after DB INSERT. 
    ***    changed action="{$plugin_guestbook_action}#entry" to action="{$commentform_action}?frontpage#feedback" inside 
           plugin_guestbook_form.tpl. This seems necessary if you use a static page as your start page. 
           Be sure to have the staticpage plugin in order before the contactform and guestbook plugin.
           Well, actually the '?frontpage' will be done in serendipity_event_guestbook.php. 
    ***    added admin stuff
    ***    modified some css

- Changed plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl. 
    ***    make use of the new smarty vars 
    ***    if set: order form on top or end and be able to even link to the form
    ***    moved some things around
    ***    added admin stuff and a missing <td></td>, which seems nessessary!
    ***    modified some css

- Changed, cleaned and modified the style_guestbook_backend.css 
    ***    you may put a very own version of both tpl and css files inside your template folder.

>> GH: TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED
- One extra dynamic field added (dyn).
    ***    I don't think there is any need to use mgroeninger's excellent dynamic function from contactform.

- In order to make things more configurable, these vars were changed or added (see also the lang files):

    *** 'headline'      ***     staticpage headline on top of page, by Garvin (v. 2.7).
    
    *** 'intro'         ***     is used for free additional text entry on top of guestbook page.
    
    *** 'pageurl'       ***     now called permalink, while pagetitle is used as the original (1.x) pageurl and for 
                                staticpage_pagetitle, see below. (Sounds a bit messy, I know, but this is more straight!)
    
    *** 'pagetitle'     ***     is used in staticpages and other templates and defines the URL of the page 
                                'index.php?serendipity[subpage]=name'.
    
    *** 'formorder'     ***     decide to have form appear first, default is form at end of entries.
    
    *** 'formpopup'     ***     decide to have the form appear in a popup page, default (yes) is no popup.

    >>GH:TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED!
    *** 'showdynfield'  ***     this is a basic dynamic field as a mysql varchar(100) field. 
                    Use with a input field in plugin_guestbook_form.tpl 
                    and as a text output in plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl.
                    I tried it with a tinyblob field, but it is not a very good idea 
                    to store binary data in databases, and so I came back to this small input text field.
                    If you want to change this field with another label name, set config dynfield to the new name and submit.

- Fixed a small bug in paginator function.

- General code clean up and moved things around. More documented code.

- Now this really is a fully template version (99.9% ;-)). 
    *** Moved some remaining divs and some admin stuff into the tpls.
    *** Sorry, there are still some needs inside functions for remaining line breaks and the urls of the paginator function.

- Good news! The code for the staticpage plugin at the end oft this page is obsolet by now. 
    *** We'll keep the compatibility to 1.x until next 3.x release. Well, actually this version should be 3.0.....


-------------------------------------
| Version 2.5 to 2.7 - 2007-??-??   |
-------------------------------------
- some tweaks by Garvin



-------------------------------------

- Guestbookform tpl action url is now: $serendipity['baseURL'] . $serendipity['indexFile'] . '#entry'

- Changed sidebar serendipity_event_staticpage.php to be compatible to guestbook 2.0 version too (code1). In case you allready used this plugin to show a link to the guestbook plugin in your sidebar, please go into admin panel, go to static pages, and say yes again to show guestbook plugin. Doing this, changes to code will take effect.

- Made sidebar serendipity_plugin_guestbook work with 2.0 version only

- Target admin mail address should now be compatible to old guestbook version 1.38 - just one targetmail used

- Markup config var makes tpl based entries textfield output get parsed through S9y standard text formatting and converting standard smilies

- Change old guestbook table now works for mysql (only?)

- More cleanup / renaming and reconfigured wordwrap in config for 2.0 final

- Now the guestbook should work well with/without CAPTCHAS - this needed a new config variable so please check your Captchas settings in spamblock and! guestbook plugins

- Generell clean up and messages tweaks.

- Now serendipity_event_guestbook is nearly full template based (see plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl and plugin_guestbook_form.tpl)

- You will find images shorttime.gif, button_background.png and delete.png in $this_plugin/img dir now.

- Change css (style_guestbook_backend.css) and template files to your needs

- Please check other lang files - actualy only <en>, <de> and <de-utf8> will work!

- Permalink ("pageurl") is a full path from http root eg. "/serendipity/pages/guestbook.html" or "/serendipity/index.php?/pages/guestbook.html" (see mod_rewrite)

- Please Note: This version is making use of plugin::spamblock features and captchas (disabled for admins),

- Please Note: timelock and sessionlock config vars will not be used anymore - removed by table update
