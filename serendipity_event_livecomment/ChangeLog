     * Added URL-Button to the comment-buttons
     * Added hovertext to buttons

    * Performance:
     * Reduced HTTP-Requests
     * Reduced size of JavaScript-files
     * Reduced DOM-traversing
     * Ajax-call no longer gets executed twice when markup-buttons and
       preview are activated

     * Added option to use inline-javascript for the parameters
     * Javascript will stop if no commentform is there

     * lcnewbase now initialize at the right position
     * Changed the way global variables were used
     * Enabled use of markup-buttons when using another
       plugin-directory than usual
