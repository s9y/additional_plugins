------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17 (brockhaus):

    * Ensure enclosures in feed, even if nothing is displayed in the 
      entry. Added an option to disable this feature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.16 (brockhaus):

    * FLV player is not displayed because of missing JavaScript, if the
      blogs entries are cached. Now the JavaScript optimization is
      optional, defaulting to false.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.15 (brockhaus):

    * FLV player was not displayed in admins preview, as the needed
      javascript is not added by the backend. In that case the JS is
      added to the body of the previewed article.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14 (brockhaus):

    * Because of license reasons I removed the JW-FLV player itself from
      the plugin distribution and added an installation information into
      the plugins configuration.
    * Adds JW-FLV JavaScript file to the header only, if an article 
      containing a JW-FLV player is shown on the page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13 (brockhaus):

    * Added JW-FLV-Player for playing flash FLV videos.

Version 1.12 (garvinhicking)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * renamed serendipity_event_podcast_player.php to
      podcast_player.php. Only s9y plugins are allowed to be
      prefixed serendipity_event_XXX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11 (brockhaus):

    * Media files added via the extended article attributes were not
      always added to the Feed as enclosures.
    * Try to make it working rudimentarily even if getid3 lib is not
      installed, found or working correctly.
    * If plugin version change, the cached fileinfos are recalculated
      automatically.
    * Added much more debug logging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10 (brockhaus):

    * If an podcast was found in one article it was added as enclosure
      to all following items in the RSS feed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.9 (brockhaus):

    * Made RSS enclosure parsing independend from existing <embed> tags.
    * Removed <embed> tags from player code to make generated code XHTML
      valid.
    * Added XSPF flash player for MP3 files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8 (brockhaus):

    * Global "Use Player" setting was ignored while podcasting with the
      extended attributes. Now a link is added to the configured place
      in the article instead of a player.
    * Encoding of fileurls made trouble, when article editor encoded
      url already (tinyEd). Now only spaces found will be encoded.
    * RSS compatibility: RSS secification supports only one enclosure.
      It is possible now to configure, that only the first media file
      found per entry will be enclosured to the RSS feed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.7 (brockhaus):

    * Made plugin unstackable.
    * Podcast files containing spaces and other special chars were 
      producing trouble in feeds. Now they will be encoded.
    * Removed extended enclosure attributes, as rss validator reports
      them to produce trouble in some RSS readers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.6 (brockhaus):

    * Podcasting using the extended article Atributes did not work
      correctly if s9y was installed on a HTTPS server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5 (brockhaus):

    * Podcasting using the extended article Atributes did not work
      correctly if s9y was installed into a subdirectory of the server.
    * Minimal performance change wish by garvin. :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4 (brockhaus):

    * Media files found in ext. article attributes are embeded into
      the article, too. (optional)
    * Players are able to autosize themselfs acording to detected video
      dimension.
    * Optimized WMP output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3 (garvinhicking):

    * PHP4 compatibility

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2 (brockhaus):

    * Linking to MP3 doesn't work in all situations. (only old podcast
      style worked)
    * For full feeds medias in the extended part of the article were
      enclosured twice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1 (brockhaus):

    * Replaces [podcast: ..] syntax with html links even if no player 
      repacement is wanted.
    * Replaced flash mp3 player with a small version of the quicktime
      player, as it is not working in IE and produced problems in RSS
      feeds.
    * Podcast Enclosure extension: expect_md5 and expect_length added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 (brockhaus):

    * Moved old [podcast: ..] style into the new plugin code
      (garvinhicking)
    * Added configurable extended article attribute configuration
    * Completely rewrote plugin. Now it has video podcasting 
      capabilities, adding podcasts to articles is MUCH easier now,
      mime-type of podcast is analysed automatically using the
      getid3 lib (http://getid3.org) wich should be located in the
      bundled-libs directory of Serendipity

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9 (Hannes Gassert):
