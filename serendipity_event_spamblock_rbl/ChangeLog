1.6:
----
 * Set 'blog.bl.zonecheck.org,sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org' as default blacklists. 'list.blogspambl.com'
   does not exist anymore.
 * Replace the Net/DNSBL requirement with a custom DNS check. This ought to make the plugin more
   resilient against PHP upgrade changes, since Net/DNSBL is not maintained anymore.

------
Hotfixes for PHP 8 (surrim)

1.5.1:
------
Fix: Don't overwrite "moderate" flags from other plugins.
