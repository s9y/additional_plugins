3.72:
-----------------------------
Fix for not being able to edit a staticpage through the frontend's

3.70, 3.71:
-----------------------------

Major new functionalities:

    1. Allow to create custom smarty templates used for editing a
       staticpage.
       
       When editing a staticpage in the backend, you now have a dropdown
       where you can choose a template. The default file is placed
       in the plugin's subdirectory "backend_templates". You can
       add files there on your own, which are then shown in the
       dropdown as well.
       
       You can override the content of those files within your
       template directory, by placing a file named exactly the same way,
       in the "backend_templates" sub-directory of your template. 
       Thus, you can put an empty file inside your plugin
       directory to initialize the ability to use a template-preference.
       
       The default template file has several smarty functions to query
       the current value and input fields. You can place all input
       fields the way you like, using Smarty/HTML layouts.
       
       You can also still switch to the "old way" through the dropdown.
       

    2. Introduce "custom properties" for staticpages.
    
        You need to add those custom properties to your custom smarty
        template, by accessing an input field "serendipity[plugin][custom][xxx]".
        The default backend template has a commented section for an
        example on how to use this.
        
        In your final smarty templates (either the staticpage_*.tpl files, or your
        usual smarty template files) you can access those custom properties through
        
        {$staticpage_custom.XXX}
        
        to place them anywhere you want.

To properly see the new layout, you might need to flush your browser's
CSS cache, as changes have been made to the plugin's CSS file.


3.61:
-----------------------------
Speed up call for getting staticpage list and cache it. Otherwise, the
plugin was unusable for thousands of staticpages, because the 
walkrecursive() function is VERY expensive.
