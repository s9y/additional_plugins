Version 0.4:
============
Changes by Thomas Hochstein <thh@inter.net>
- Require s9y 2.2.1-alpha1 or higher due to backend template changes
  missing in older versions.
- Change table columns counter_public and counter_private to
  VARCHAR(32) as MySQL doesn't accept UNIQUE constraints on TEXT
  or BLOB columns.
- Fix MySQL comparison (use "=" instead of "=="); otherwise, no
  counter codes will ever be found.
- Fix concatenation of body and extended, fixing wrong length
  calculations for all entries with an extended entry.
- Internationalisation.
