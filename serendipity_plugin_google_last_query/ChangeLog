Version 1.14 (brockhaus)

    * Changed code, so that more engines can be added very easy
    * Added more engines found in my google analytics: 
      freenet.de, t-online.de, web.de, ixquick.com, MySpace, 
      Metager2.de, 1&1
    * Stats: Shows engines only, that delivered hits, sorted by 
      relevance.
    * Configurable, which of the known engines should be used
     (for performance reasons).
    * Cache of SQL queries for performance
    * Search hits can be switched off (only the stats will be shown then)
    * stackable

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13 (brockhaus)

    * BugFix: search engine statistics loaded *all* entries, not the
      entries of the last X days. :-/

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12 (brockhaus)

    * Optional statistic output: Count of queries per search engine the
      last X days.
    * more refactoring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11 (brockhaus)

    * Time of query visible via title attribute (optonal).
    * Show last queries to users only, who are logged in (optional)
    * Removed duplicate code, refactoring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10 (brockhaus)

    * Added scroogle.org and bing.com searches
    * Yahoo searches tested successfully
    * Added optional icons representing the search enginge
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.07 (brockhaus)

    * Support for yahoo searches added (not testet yet, as yahoo doesn't
      find me)
    * Removed unused browser image code and laguage support
    * If visitors table choosen but not existing, fallback to references
      produced a PHP error about a missing function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.06 (brockhaus)

    * Coding style
    * Linking to google from search words didn't work correctly anymore

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.05 (brockhaus)

    * The plugin is now configurable to evaluate the visitors table
      instead of the referrers table. This gives immidiate results
      instead of results about searches executed a couple of times.
      This is only working, if the statistics plugin is installed.

    * Option for opening the google search links in a new window.

    * Prepared functionality showing browser icons near the search
      words, but I switched it off, because I wasn't able to create
      nice icons. ;-)
